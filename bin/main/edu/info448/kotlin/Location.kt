/* Step 0: Define a _data class_ called `City` that will represent the location 
   of a city. A City should have three properties: a `name` (String), `latitude`
   (Double), and `longitude` (Double).
*/



/* Step 1: Define a function called `listCities()` that returns a `list` of 
   City objects representing the following U.S. cities:
    {name: "Atlanta", latitude: 33.7490, longitude: -84.3880}
    {name: "Bothell", latitude: 47.7601, longitude: -122.2054},
    {name: "New York", latitude: 40.7128, longitude: -74.0060}
    {name: "San Francisco", latitude: 37.7749, longitude: -122.4194},
    {name: "Tacoma", latitude: 47.2529, longitude: -122.4443},

   Call your function from inside the provided `main()` method, saving the result
   to a local variable called `cityLocations`. Print this out to check your work.
*/



/* Step 2: Define a function `distanceFromSeattle()` that takes as a param a 
   City object and return the distance in kilometers (Double) between that city 
   and Seattle, WA (latitude: 47.6062, longitude: -122.3321).

   You can use the `haversine()` function provided below to calculate the 
   distance in km between two points on the globe.

   Call your function from inside the provided `main()` method and print out the
   distance between Seattle and Tacoma (should be about 40km)
*/



//Calculates the distance in km between two points on a globe
//Implementation from http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Haversine_formula
fun haversine(lat1: Double, lon1: Double, lat2: Double, lon2: Double): Double {
    val R = 6372.8 // in kilometers
    val l1 = Math.toRadians(lat1)
    val l2 = Math.toRadians(lat2)
    val dl = Math.toRadians(lat2 - lat1)
    val dr = Math.toRadians(lon2 - lon1)
    return 2 * R * Math.asin(Math.sqrt(Math.pow(Math.sin(dl / 2), 2.0) + Math.pow(Math.sin(dr / 2), 2.0) * Math.cos(l1) * Math.cos(l2)))
}

/* Step 3: In the provided `main()` method, call the `map()` method of the
   `cityLocations` list, passing it your `distanceFromSeattle()` function in
   order to get a list of distance between the cities and Seattle. Print
   the resulting list.
   Note that you will need use `::` to specify your function (e.g., `::foo`
   refers to the `foo()` function in the current file).
*/


/* Step 4: In the provided `main()` method, call the `filter()` method of the
   `cityLocations` list, passing it an _anonymous function_ used to filter the
   list. This function should return `true` if the given City is "far" from 
   Seattle (further away than 50km). Print out the resulting list.
*/


/* Step 5: In the provided `main()` method, use the `map()` and `filter() 
   methods to get a list of the `names` of cities that are in the "West",  
   meaning west of the Mississippi river. For our purposes, the Mississippi is 
   at longitude -89.97803 E (so anything "less than" that is to its west).
   Use two _lambda expressions_ to do this; utilize the implicit `it` parameter.
   Print out the resulting list. 

   Hint: filter for western cities, and then map the results to a list of names
   (Strings).
*/


/* Step 6: In the provided `main()` method, use the `maxBy()` method of the
   `cityLocations` list to find which city is the furthest from Seattle.
   Since the last (and only) parameter to the `maxBy()` method is a function,
   you should omit the parentheses from the method call.
   Print the resulting city.

   Hint: https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/max-by.html
*/


/* Step 7: In the provided `main()` method, use the `fold()` method to produce a
   variable called `citiesByName` that is a `Map<String, City>` object, where 
   each key is the name of a city (String) and the value is the City object.
   Print the resulting map.

   Hint: You will need to create an empty `MutableMap<String, City>` as an 
   initial value.

   Note: The `groupBy()` method is a cleaner way of achieving this same result,
   but you must use the `fold()` method for practice.
